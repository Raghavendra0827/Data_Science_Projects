# Regression Visualization App

Welcome to the Regression Visualization App! This app allows you to visualize and compare different types of regression models: Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Ridge Regression.

## Features

- **2D Visualization**: Plot 2D graphs showing the regression lines and data points.
- **3D Visualization**: View 3D scatter plots with actual data points and predicted values.
- **Interactivity**: Adjust parameters such as alpha value for Lasso and Ridge Regression using sidebar sliders.

## How to Use

1. **Select Regression Type**: Choose between Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Ridge Regression from the sidebar dropdown menu.
2. **Adjust Parameters**: For Lasso and Ridge Regression, use the sidebar slider to adjust the alpha value.
3. **Visualize**: Explore the 2D and 3D visualizations to gain insights into the regression models and their performance.

## About the Models

- **Linear Regression**: Fits a linear model to the data, minimizing the sum of squared residuals.
- **Lasso Regression**: Performs L1 regularization, adding a penalty term to the absolute values of the coefficients.
- **Ridge Regression**: Applies L2 regularization, adding a penalty term to the square of the coefficients.
